# MNIST-Number-and-Letter-Detection

Using the MNIST database for number detection, and the EMNIST extension for letter detection. Using tensorflow for machine learning.

For a more direct comparison between digitdetector and letterdetector, I made a new file called newtest.py.
It runs the letterdetector setup if you type "true", and digitdetector setup if you type anything else. Both use the same neural network afterwards.
